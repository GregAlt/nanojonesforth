   NanoJonesForth is a project to shrink the assembly language from jonesforth,
   moving words into forth source while maintaining compatibility.

   I'm trying to balance a few somewhat conflicting goals:
   - Minimal nanojonesforth.S file size
   - Simple and straightforward nanojonesforth.S file (no obfuscations)
   - Minimal stripped .elf result
   - No assembly language outside of forth definitions
   - Minimal number of defcode words
   - No complex defcode words
   - Minimal number of defvar and defconst words
   - After reducing defcode words, minimal number of defword compiled forth words
   - Good performance is not a goal, but I'll avoid gratuitous bad performance
   - Compatibility with jonesforth, including all tests passing
       (with minor adjustments for specific offsets in exception and stack tests)
   - No handcrafted .elf - the elf will be built with standard tools and stripped

Based on https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth/tree/master which describes itself as:

This is a mirror of Richard WM Jones's excellent literate x86 assembly
implementation of Forth, more on which here:
